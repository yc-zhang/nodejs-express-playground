# Playground of Express

This is an example nodejs express project, which I'm seeking if it easy to use it build RESTFul web services.

The following points should be checked during this spike, to make sure everything is ready.

- [ ] Dockerised
- [ ] Route binding.
- [ ] ORM integration.
- [ ] Middleware binding.
- [ ] Authentication & Log & Throughput Limitation.
- [ ] Consider the Ngnix as reverse proxy
- [ ] Unit test.
